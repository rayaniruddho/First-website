                <p>The multiverse (or meta-universe) is the hypothetical set of finite and infinite possible universes, including the universe in which we live. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, and the physical laws and constants that describe them.</p>
                <p>The various universes within the multiverse are called "parallel universes", "other universes" or "alternate universes."
                The American philosopher and psychologist William James used the term multiverse in 1895, but in a different context.

                <h2>Origin</h2>
                <p>In Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schrödinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience  that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic." He said that, when his Nobel equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously." This is the earliest known reference to the multiverse.</p>

            <section id="2">
                <h2>Explanation</h2>
                <p>The structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it, and the relationships among these universes differ from one multiverse hypothesis to another.</p>
                <p>Multiple universes have been hypothesized                                                                                                    in cosmology, physics, astronomy, religion, philosophy, transpersonal psychology, and literature, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called "alternate universes", "quantum universes", "interpenetrating dimensions", "parallel dimensions", "parallel worlds", "alternate realities", "alternate timelines", and "dimensional planes".</p>
                <p>The physics community continues to debate the multiverse hypothesis. Prominent physicists disagree about whether the multiverse exists.</p>
                <p>Some physicists say the multiverse is not a legitimate topic of scientific inquiry. Concerns have been raised about whether attempts to exempt the multiverse from experimental verification could erode public confidence in science and ultimately damage the study of fundamental physics. Some have argued that the multiverse is a philosophical rather than a scientific hypothesis because it cannot be falsified. The ability to disprove a theory by means of scientific experiment has always been part of the accepted scientific method. Paul Steinhardt has famously argued that no experiment can rule out a theory if the theory provides for all possible outcomes. </p>
                <p>In 2007, Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg suggested that if the multiverse existed, "the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our Big Bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live."</p>

                <h2>Search</h2>
                <p>Around 2010, scientists such as Stephen M. Feeney analyzed Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data and claimed to find evidence suggesting that our universe collided with other (parallel) universes in the distant past. However, a more thorough analysis of data from the WMAP and from the Planck satellite, which has a resolution 3 times higher than WMAP, did not reveal any statistically significant evidence of such a bubble universe collision. In addition, there was no evidence of any gravitational pull of other universes on ours.</p>

                <h2>Proponents and skeptics</h2>
                <p>Proponents of one of the multiverse hypotheses include Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, Michio Kaku, David Deutsch, Leonard Susskind, Alexander Vilenkin, Yasunori Nomura, Raj Pathria, Laura Mersini-Houghton, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Sean Carroll. </p>
                <p>Scientists who are generally skeptical of the multiverse hypothesis include: Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg, Nobel laureate David Gross, Paul Steinhardt, Neil Turok,  Viatcheslav Mukhanov, Michael S. Turner, Roger Penrose, George Ellis, Joe Silk, Adam Frank, Marcelo Gleiser, Jim Baggott, and Paul Davies.</p>

                <h2>Arguments against the theory</h2>
                <p>In his 2003 New York Times opinion piece, A Brief History of the Multiverse, the author and cosmologist Paul Davies offered a variety of arguments that multiverse theories are non-scientific : </p>
                <p>For a start, how is the existence of the other universes to be tested? To be sure, all cosmologists accept that there are some regions of the universe that lie beyond the reach of our telescopes, but somewhere on the slippery slope between that and the idea that there are an infinite number of universes, credibility reaches a limit. As one slips down that slope, more and more must be accepted on faith, and less and less is open to scientific verification. Extreme multiverse explanations are therefore reminiscent of theological discussions. Indeed, invoking an infinity of unseen universes to explain the unusual features of the one we do see is just as ad hoc as invoking an unseen Creator. The multiverse theory may be dressed up in scientific language, but in essence it requires the same leap of faith.
                — Paul Davies, A Brief History of the Multiverse</p>
                <p>Taking cosmic inflation as a popular case in point, George Ellis, writing in August 2011, provided a balanced criticism of not only the science but, as he suggested, the scientific philosophy by which multiverse theories are generally substantiated.</p>
                <p>He, like most cosmologists, accepts Tegmark's level-I "domains", even though they lie far beyond the cosmological horizon. Likewise, the multiverse of cosmic inflation is said to exist very far away. It would be so far away, however, that it's very unlikely any evidence of an early interaction will be found. He argues that, for many theorists, the lack of empirical testability or falsifiability is not a major concern.</p>
                <p>Many physicists who talk about the multiverse, especially advocates of the string landscape, do not care much about parallel universes per se. For them, objections to the multiverse as a concept are unimportant. Their theories live or die based on internal consistency and, one hopes, eventual laboratory testing.</p>
                <p>Although he believes there's little hope that laboratory testing will ever be possible, he grants that the theories on which speculation is based have some scientific merit. He concluded that multiverse theory is a "productive research program":</p>
                <p>As skeptical as I am, I think the contemplation of the multiverse is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the nature of science and on the ultimate nature of existence: why we are here.... In looking at this concept, we need an open mind, though not too open. It is a delicate path to tread. Parallel universes may or may not exist; the case is unproved. We are going to have to live with that uncertainty. Nothing is wrong with scientifically based philosophical speculation, which is what multiverse proposals are. But we should name it for what it is.
                — George Ellis, Scientific American, Does the Multiverse Really Exist?
